# iOS Shortcuts (was Workflow)

This repository is intended to be a collection of different automation workflows to be
used with the iOS 12 Shortcut application.

Few workflows, built with the Workflow application are available as legacy.

Hope this will be usefull.

Feel free to contact me and propose any shortcut/workflow (Oh that naming is driving me mad!).

I'm going to work on a simple way to propose a shortcut via a webform.
In the meantime please create pull-requests with a new folder for each shortcut containing:

- short description in markdown
- screenshot of the workflow if possible
- the workflow as exported by the Shortcut application wqhen you share as file.

**Important**

For obvious security/privacy reason, each submitted workflow need to be reviewed and shall _not_ contain
any private information (email, phone, etc.) and sensitive data (credentials, API keys, etc).
